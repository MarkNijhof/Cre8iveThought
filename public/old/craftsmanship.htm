					<h1>Craftsmanship</h1>

						<p>The pure passion for the craft, the ever present need to expand his 
						knowledge and improve his skills that is what sets apart a craftsman 
						from the other professionals in his profession. This need has nothing to do with being better than his peers; it is about being better 
						than yesterday and the ability to make increasingly better decisions. 
						The craftsman takes great pride and pleasure in the work he does 
						and the solutions he ﬁnds; continuously thriving for perfection. The 
						craftsman always shares his knowledge and experience with others expecting them to beneﬁt from his advice, and at the same time hoping 
						to be challenged so he as well will learn something new.</p> 
						
					<h2>Software Craftsmanship</h2>
						<p>The software craftsman is like any other craftsman; he understands 
						that writing software is a crafts and as such it deserves to be takes 
						seriously. He always thrives to deliver software the best way he can, 
						providing what is needed, and ensuring that it is created with the 
						future in mind. The software craftsman will constantly try to increase 
						his knowledge and skills, partly because of the great passion he has 
						for the craft, but also because he knows that this will give him more 
						possible solutions to future challenges. A software craftsman is a 
						valuable asset in any software development team.</p>
						
						<h2>Software Development</h2>
						<p><div id="quote" style="margin-left:120px;">”The ultimate purpose of software is to serve users. But first, that same software has to serve developers.”<br />--Eric Evans</div></p>
						<p>In these two sentences Eric manages to capture the essence of software development and why a quality development process is important. As a software craftsman I take both important points to hart and use them in my decision making process.</p>

						<p>In order to ensure that the software serves the user it needs to be developed using a process that enables a lot of feedback and change. This process should also focus on delivering value first, meaning the more valuable features should be developed before less valuable features. The Agile methodology provides a process that offers this flexibility; one of its main principles is that software is developed in short iterations, resulting in a fast feedback cycle and opportunity to change priorities. This ensured Eric’s point that the software should serve the users.</p>

						<p>Serving developers however has got noting to do with serving users (not directly anyway). This means that while the software is build the developers should find it easy to work in the code as well as making changes to it. This is achieved by applying the proper principles, patterns and practices to the development process. A software craftsman can assert which of these is appropriate to use in a given scenario.</p>
