I have changed my blog design as you may have seen already, well a better way would be saying that I have changed it again. And I thought that I would just write something about why I made certain things the way they are. 

Now lets get one thing straight; I am not a designer, but I do have opinions about design :)

Lets take a look at why people would be visiting my blog; I can only make wild guesses as I have not done any market research. One guess would be that they in a wild furry of frustration hitting and slamming the keyboard, because they found someone wrong on the internet, managed to type in the URL directly. Or that my site is one of those sites selected by the [Google Sting Operation](http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-is-cheating-copying-our-search-results-62914) and thus got top ranking for un-related searches. 

Anyway once you are here, frustrated or not, I rudely assume you are here to read.

##Reading##

Indeed reading is 

Now I noticed by myself that many things I read on the internet are not very readable, very often the font is to small and the lines are to long. And sometimes there are just so many distractions from the actual content that reading it becomes painful. I mean there is even an app to remove all the shit. Now I have always liked reading [Rob Conery's blog](http://blog.wekeroad.com/) and one thing that I noticed is that I **always** open his posts in his blog, not in the reader I use. And why, well because it is more pleasant to read it there, then inside the reader. So his design has been an inspiration for sure.

Also if you read about it then they say that ["lines should be no longer than 75-85 characters"](http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/276) and from the same article:
> "Printing and publishing typographers figured out a long time ago that most people can read no more than 10 to 12 words per line before they have trouble differentiating lines from each other"

###Large font, short lines###

So lets take a look at that, maximum 10 to 12 words on a line, well I didn't get it that small, but I am very close. The sentences are below 75 characters per line so I am good there. Also I made the font large, I can easily read it from a small distance.
