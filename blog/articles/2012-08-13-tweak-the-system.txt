I work as an Agile Coach currently at Avira, our goal is to faster deliver valuable software to our customers. So as an Agile Coach I try to tweak the system in which we work. 

In the past I have been more focussed on optimizing the parts that I saw and could optimize; but I have never really tried to understand what the effect of these optimizations would have on the whole system. Thankfully I am also being coached here by [Vasco Duarte](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco) who has already enlightened me (a bit) with his Meta Coaching exercises (more on that in a next post). 

So now instead of optimizing parts of the system I now try to see what effect such optimizations would have on the whole system, not just to the part being optimized. 

Personally I am a big fan of visualizing things using graphics, so together with my college [Luis Gonsalves](https://twitter.com/lgoncalves1979) I thought of a small example of how I would like to visualize the throughput (velocity if you will) of a development team. 

## The team
The composition of the team is rather complex, we came from an environment where different expertise's (like development and testing) where setup in different departments and they formed the well known silo's. In an effort to minimize communication overhead and many other problems we now have feature teams which are composed out of people from the different departments. A team as such is cross-functional but the team members are not. 

So one team is composed out of:<br />
- 1 Project Owner <br />
- 1 Project Manager (comparable with a Scrum Master role) <br />
- 5 Developers <br />
- 0.5 Localization (shared between teams) <br />
- 0.5 Documentation (shared between teams) <br />
- 2 Manual testers <br />
- 0.5 Test Automation (shared between teams) <br />

Then when we look at what each mini silo can do within a 2 week iteration. I am not tracking the PO here as there should be a significant backlog and the PM is a facilitator and as such he/she does not produce output. The developers can finish about 8 stories during an iteration and the same applies for the documentation people. However the manual testers and he localization people can finish about 6 stories per iteration. And finally the Test Automation person can automate the manual tests for about 3 stories per iterations.

The number of stories per iteration: <br />
- 8 for Developers <br />
- 6 for Localization (shared between teams) <br />
- 8 for Documentation (shared between teams) <br />
- 6 for Manual testers <br />
- 3 for Test Automation <br />

When this team selects their stories they mostly use the 6 story baseline ignoring that Test Automation cannot finish all the work.

## Visualization
Of-course when looking at it like this it is quit easy to pinpoint a bottle neck, but what I am looking at achieving is a way to make this process even quicker.

So I want to draw a picture of the system as we see it (of-course this is still only a small part of the whole system in which we work).

<img src="http://cre8ivethought.com/images/general/flow-1.jpg" alt="The System as it is" style="border: solid 1px black; float:right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;"/>What you see here is a quick draft of the throughput of this team, now you can see in one quick look that the biggest bottleneck lies with Test Automation. They are only able to do 3 stories per iteration. 

Now depending on how many stories get selected we can easily calculate and show where people are waiting and where a queue with unfinished work is formed. 

In the case where the team takes 6 stories we can see that the Developers are waiting 25 percent of the time and that there will be a queue of 3 stories that Test Automation was unable to finish.

## Variables
What if we could change some variables from the above setup? 

Having the Developers wait for 25 percent of the iteration is of-course not good. We could have them do 8 stories instead, but that would only increase the queues for the others.

What if instead of waiting we ask the Developers to spend the 25 percent on writing Automated tests that normally would be defined by the Manual Testers and then automated by the Test Automation person?

Let's say that the Developers are able to create about half of the tests the Manual Testers would define. That would mean that potentially the velocity of the Manual Testers gets increased by 50 percent i.e. they would be able to do 9 stories per iteration.

But since the Developers have automated these tests also the Test Automation person has less tests to automate, in this case he or she only has to automate the remaining 50 percent of the tests (the manual tests) for each story which would increase the number of stories he or she can finish to 6 per iteration.

<img src="http://cre8ivethought.com/images/general/flow-2.jpg" alt="The System as it might be" style="border: solid 1px black; float:right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" />When we now take a look at the second picture we can clearly see a big difference in through-put. Suddenly the whole team would be able to finish 6 stories per iteration instead of 3. It may be true that the developers are not producing the optimum output they could achieve which would be 8 stories per iteration, but the system as a whole benefits greatly from this by having the output doubled.

## The question
My thought is; being able to show with visualizations what the impact of certain changes would be, like having the developers write automated tests, will make it easier to understand for most people.

You may have noticed that I ignored the order in which the work happens, but this could also greatly impact how a team works.

What other visualizations would you use to tell the story?
