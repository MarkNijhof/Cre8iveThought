title: The Amazon Experiment

This is a post about an Amazon Experiment I executed on the 24th of January. It was mostly for fun, and to see how long it would take Amazon to stop it. My hypothesis was that it would at least take a few days (~3 days) for Amazon to take action.

I was only partly wrong :-)

# Opening an Amazon seller account
This was easy, actually the whole process was really easy.

# Detected!
As you can see it took Amazon only 5 hours and 19 minutes to figure out that I was doing something they didn't like.

Actually I looked at their guidelines and couldn't actually find which rule I broke, so I asked:

__"Thank you for writing. We took this action because we restrict the listing or sale of these products to pre-approved sellers. According to our records, you have not been authorized to offer these products on Amazon.com."__

Hmm so someone else can sell me but I can't :-)

# Google search
Funnily enough if you would now search on Google for "Remote Freelance Developer" you would still find my Amazon product (in my case last result on the first page).

# The reviews
An other curious thing is that the reviews given to the "Remote Freelance Developer" product are still accessible

# The outcome

So I was absolutely right in the assumption that this would be fun to do. I was however wrong in my assumption that it would take Amazon about 3 days to detect my experiment, they did it in only 5 hours and 19 minutes. And that is impressive.
