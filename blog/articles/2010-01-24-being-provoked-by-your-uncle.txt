So there was a lot of commotion about two blog posts by Uncle Bob Martin; [Dependency Injection Inversion](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2010/01/17/dependency-injection-inversion) and [Mocking Mocking and Testing Outcomes](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2010/01/23/mocking-mocking-and-testing-outcomes). With replies from people like Jimmy Bogard “[Poor use of DI versus need for DI](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2010/01/18/poor-use-of-di-versus-need-for-di.aspx)” and Ayende “[Rejecting Dependency Injection Inversion](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2010/01/22/rejecting-dependency-injection-inversion.aspx)”. And also on Twitter there were many discussions going back and forth about it.

I would like to leave the discussion for what it is and focus on another aspect of the story. Apparently Uncle Bob was trying to provoke a reaction from his readers, but this was not very obvious in the blog posts themselves.

And that is something which I didn’t expect from my uncle. Usually my uncle is the one that provides very good insights and advice. Yes perhaps controversial and challenging but with a clear message. I mean normally it is the neighbor that is very provoking, I expect this from him so I read his posts in a completely different light.

I guess what I want to say is that if you have a certain established role within your community or team and then suddenly change the intent of your messages then you will mostly get confusion instead of anything else. In this case I believe my uncle would be able to send out the same message but in a way that is clearly provoking you to think. And thus achieving the wanted results I am sure.

Because there is absolutely nothing wrong about being provoked into thinking. On that note I am sure my uncle will continue doing so, in new ways perhaps.
