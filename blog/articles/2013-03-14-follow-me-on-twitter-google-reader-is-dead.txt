title: Follow me on Twitter Google Reader is dead

So they terminated Google Reader; a huge pain because now I have to keep track of my comics in an other way. But I noticed that many subscribers actually use Google Reader heavily. So to them I would like to suggest to follow me on Twitter instead, to receive updates: [@MarkNijhof](https://twitter.com/MarkNijhof)
