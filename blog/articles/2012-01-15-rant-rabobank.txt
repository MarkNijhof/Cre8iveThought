title: Rant - Rabobank
author: Mark Nijhof
published: false

It is sad to comeback after New Years with a rant post, but this is something I need to get out of my system. So here we go:

## tl;dr

On December the 21st 2011 I transferred €400,- from my Dutch bank account at the [Rabobank](http://www.rabobank.nl/) to my Norwegian bank account at [Skandiabanken](http://www.skandiabanken.no/). Somewhere this transaction got lost. I have used the correct account information for the transaction which is confirmed by the SWIFT message I got from the Rabobank. But then the Rabobank suddenly needed €50,- in order to start an investigation to find-out what actually happened with my money. 

And that is what annoys me!

## The transaction

My wife has a tendency to buy things in Norway since well ... she is Norwegian :) So I quite regularly transfer money from my Rabobank account to my Skandiabanken account. I have created an address book entry in the Rabobank online facilities so I don't have to write down all the account details each time I want to transfer some money from my Dutch account to Norway. 

I always use this address book facility when transferring money between my accounts and this time when I transferred €400,- on December the 21st was no different. I requested high priority to speed up the transfer as well. All looked well, within a minute or so the transaction was approved and the money was out of my account the day after.

## But it never arrived 

I knew Christmas was in between but on December the 30th I called both banks to ask what was going on. Skandiabanken told me they hadn't received any payments yet and asked me to contact the sending bank. The Rabobank told me that the Norwegian bank indeed couldn't have seen the payment because <b>the payment wasn't offered to them yet</b>. He didn't know why this hadn't happened yet but he said everything about the transfer was in order and asked me to be a bit more patience.

On January the 2nd I figured that now it should have arrived and I contacted both banks again. Also this time Skandiabanken could not find the payment and requested more information, Skandiabanken was really helpful.

The Rabobank however told me the transfer was executed on December the 22nd 2011 and that they could see nothing wrong. Interesting fact was that now <b>the money was offered on December the 22nd</b>, which was not the case when I spoke to them on the 30th. But I guess to be human is to error and that even at the Rabobank things can go wrong.

I told the Rabobank that my Norwegian bank couldn't find any trace of the transaction but that they could take an other look when they receive more detailed information. At which the Rabobank responded that they could start an investigation to figure out what had happened with the transaction, but if I wanted them to do that I would have to pay €50,-.

## Excuse me! €50,-

So if I wanted the Rabobank to investigate what <b>they</b> had done with my money transfer <b>I</b> had to <b>pay them €50,-</b>.

Shocked I told the Rabobank that instead I needed the exact details of the transfer so my Norwegian bank could take an other more detailed look first. I received a SWIFT message from the Rabobank which I forwarded to Skandiabanken. BTW The SWIFT message confirmed that the correct details where used in the transaction.

<i>Unrelated note: I really expected XML instead of something that looks like JSON.</i>

But even with this detailed information Skandiabanken could not find any trace of the transaction and they told me the correct approach is to have the sending bank start an investigation.

So on the 12th of January I send the Rabobank an e-mail stating the results from Skandiabankens efforts as well as my point of view on the matter. That I believe the Rabobank is responsible for the execution of the transaction and that I find it very customer unfriendly and to be honest a slap in my face that I have to pay for having the Rabobank start an investigation to find-out what the Rabobank has done wrong. I said that I saw two options, either they still make sure the transfer is properly executed or they return the money back into my Dutch account.

Hallo,

Ik had het SWIFT bericht al een tweede keer naar de Noorse bank
verstuurd met hetzelfde resultaat. Het advies van de Noorse bank is
dat de versturende bank dit dient uit te zoeken.

In mijn belevenis is het de Rabobank die verantwoordelijk is voor het
overboeken van geld wanneer dit gebeurd via de online faciliteiten van
de Rabobank zelf. Daarnaast heb ik voor de overboeking de adresboek
faciliteiten van de Rabobank gebruikt, welke ik vele malen eerder en
zelfs ook na deze transactie met succes heb gebruikt om de juiste
gegevens van de Noorse ontvangende bank in te voeren. En dat dit ook
in deze transactie juist was gebeurd blijkt wel uit julie eigen
gegenereerde SWIFT bericht.

Kort gezegd: Ik hou de Rabobank verantwoordelijk voor het juist
uitvoeren van de overboeking, echter heeft de Rabobank dit verzuimd te
doen, en daarnaast heeft de Rabobank wel het over te boeken bedrag van
mijn rekening afgeschreven. Om mij dan Euro 50,- in rekening te
brengen om dit op te lossen is hetzelfde als mij een klap in mijn
gezicht te geven. Onbehoorlijk en zeker niet klantvriendelijk.

Ik zie dus twee alternatieven die de Rabobank heeft:

1) Zorg dragen dat de overboeking alsnog juist wordt uitgeverd.</br>
2) De orginele overboeking terug draaien door het geld terug te boeken
op mijn Rabobank rekening

Dan zijn er ook nog de kosten die ik heb moeten betalen voor de spoed
overboeking, deze zullen ook terug geboekt moeten worden aangezien we
momenteel op 22 dagen zitten voor de overboeking we in aller
redelijkheid niet meer van een spoed transactie kunnen spreken.

De gemiste rente op de Noorse bank rekening of de oplopende debit
rente op de Rabobank rekening (afhankelijk van de optie die jullie
zullen kiezen) zal ik maar gewoon vergeten.

Mvg,

-Mark

The next day I received a call from the Rabobank restating that if they have to start an investigation (Pega dossier) into the disappearance of my money that I will have to pay €50,-. I of-course said that I found that ridicules that I have to pay to find out what the Rabobank did wrong with my transaction. The Rabobank responded that I created the transaction and that they are not responsible for that. I reminded the Rabobank that the SWIFT message confirmed that the details of the transaction were correct. It didn't matter.

I asked if I would receive my €50,- back when the investigation found that the fault was at the Rabobank, on which the Rabobank answered that the Rabobank wouldn't have made a fault. I mentioned that I work in software and yet have to see bug free software. Finally after asking 2 more time the Rabobank said that in case of a mistake at the Rabobank I would get the €50,- back, but that I still have to pay it to start the investigation.

Finally I said; <b>"So I guess I'll have to pay the €50,- or else it will cost me €400,-"</b> on which she replied; <b>"That is correct"</b>. So I caved and told the Rabobank that I wanted an investigation to be started.

So far I have not heard back from the Rabobank except that the investigation is now started, granted that only happened after I asked about it.

## High Priority

One other thing is that I still paid for the high priority option of the money transfer.

I hate to think how long a "normal" transaction would take, oh wait I know it takes one to four days (from experience) not the 36 and counting days this transaction takes.

## Rabobank

So lets take a quick look who the Rabobank is:

Rabobank's roots lie in agriculture. In 1898 two separate cooperative banks - the Coöperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Bank in Utrecht and the Coöperatieve Centrale Boerenleenbank in Eindhoven - were founded by enterprising rural folk, who, with little access to the capital market, decided to help one another.

## Customer Service

I have been with the Rabobank since I was a little boy. There was a small gap of 3 years when I went to Norway the first time, but on my return I readily opened a new account at the Rabobank again. And now that I am self employed I have also been talking to the Rabobank about a business account, life insurance, invalidity insurance and other things. I know that this still makes me a very small fish, but I would have hoped for a better customer service experience.

Because after all; <b>THIS IS NOT MY FAULT!</b>
