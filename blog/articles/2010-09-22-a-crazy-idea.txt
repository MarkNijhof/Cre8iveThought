title: A Crazy Idea

Some time ago after the NNUG yearly meeting I was talking to [Sondre Bjell√•s](http://twitter.com/SondreB) and [Lisbeth Skogland](http://twitter.com/LizSkogland) and one thing led to another and suddenly we were talking about arranging a conference. 

But not any conference may I add:

##Air Conf##

The name may have given you a clue, but this is a conference held in the air. Imagine getting on an Airbus A380 in London Heathrow with destination New York; together with 350 - 400 other highly motivated craftsman? We would take-off late in the morning, and flight time would be around 8 hours. 

Instead of the boring old stuff that is normally provided on a flight, we have speakers presenting their ideas and experiences about software development to us. Now **that** is inflight entertainment if you ask me.

##On a plane, really?##

Well think of it; what is a conference to employers? 

Probably most of them see it as something they can do for their employees. A nice treat as it where, but something that actually adds value as well, in the form of knowledge building / sharing. 

So what **Air Conf** offers it exactly that, one 8 hour flight with the best inflight entertainment solution ever. Then one full day in a great place; like for example New York. And finally an other 8 hour fully information packed flight back home. How amazingly cool would that be?

##Really, You mean on a plane?##

Well an Airbus A380 holds about 525 passengers; which means that there is enough space for about 350 - 400 craftsman and still have some place for a more quite area.

Looking at the seating layout of a normal configured A380 I can clearly imagine that we will be able to have four simultaneous tracks and have a common area. And of-course the speakers area is taken care of on the first class deck. 

Most planes actually offer the ability to reconfigure the layout somewhat if needed, so this will probably be the case for **Air Conf**, but not like this VIP layout:

##Four Different Tracks##

We will have to make sure that once people pick a track that they would be happy most of the time there, as I am sure that the pilots don't want massive groups of people moving in the plane. Also a clear maximum number of people per track would be something that is enforced, we can't all sit in the back.

Making the speaker properly visible for all attendees in the track will be a bit more of a challenge, I am thinking about removing the middle seats of the first few rows in each track creating enough space. Also the choice of airplane is important. The Boeing 777 offers more head space then for example the Boeing 747. The Airbus 380 offer lots of head space and can carry more people, but can we get one?

Half way into the trip there will be food, and I am sure we will be able to get something better then that awful airplane food :) 

###Agile Train###

This is sort of done before, but then it was on a train, this was [Agile Train from Oslo to Trondheim going to XP 2010](http://xp2010.org/content.ap?thisId=68) and I believe it was a great success. A train is of-course more limited in respect to its destinations, and a plane is just so much cooler!

##The Speakers##

There are many speakers who travel between Europe and the US for work; so I figured is that some speakers perhaps only want to be on **Air Conf** one way. For example someone from Europe would be at **Air Conf** on the first leg, but will stay in the US to do some consulting. In the US we would pick-up another speaker for the second leg back home.

But realistically will they join such an endeavor? I think they will, it is going to be super exciting and not done before (exactly the right ingredients).

##But can it actually be done?##

Yes!

I have already been talking to an Air Charter and the first response was that it isn't all that crazy after all.

##Your Feedback##

Yeah I would really like to hear what **you** have to say about this!

- Would you sign-up for this conference?
- Would you want to present at this conference?
- Why is it completely ridicules and will it never work?
- Why is this perfect and amazing that it took so long before someone thought of it?

So I like to hear positive _and_ negative feedback!
