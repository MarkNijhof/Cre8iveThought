On the 1st of June I will start with a new job in the south of Germany to help transform the company into a more Agile way of working, the title I got there is Agile Coach and I am the second one they have employed. The company is Avira the free anti-virus company also one of the top web-companies in the world with 100+ Million customers. 

This new role is a huge change from what I have been doing so far; instead of writing software I will get a facilitating role helping others write (better) software. Initially I will have a strong technical focus as that is where most of my knowledge lies; this is also what is really needed right now. But I will gradually expand my knowledge to be able to help out on management levels as well. 

I have long been dreaming for such a job where I can really focus on helping others and now it has come, thanks to [J.B. Rainsberger](https://twitter.com/#!/jbrains) for the introduction.

Some of the tasks I expect are: 

Help developers with the transition to Agile<br/>
- by pair programming<br/>
- by implementing different processes like proper CI<br/>
- by helping write good tests<br/>
- by doing (nearly) anything that helps them improve

Help with creating an internal community<br/>
- to make people enthusiastic <br/>
- to make daily work fun<br/>
- to facilitate knowledge sharing <br/>
- to enable outside of the box thinking

Help non-developers with the transition to Agile<br/>
- the whole organization needs to change, this will be strange for all of them, this is also a new area for me

I also expect that I'll be blogging more again.   

I will be working with my colleague [Vasco Duarte](https://twitter.com/#!/duarte_vasco) who has been working in this role at Avira for a while now. I expect to learn a lot from him while working there.

I will bring my family as well (as of 22nd Cattleya has joined the ranks as #4) as we will move to Friedrichshafen right at the Bodensee. And this also completes one other goal I had in life; move to a better climate. All though this is not Spain or Australia; it is nicer then at home and still close enough for frequent visits.
