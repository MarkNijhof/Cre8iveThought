And this time it is no different, again I wanted the experience on my blog to be about the content. It should be easy to read and no distractions.

I got inspired by IA Writer which is a really good editor (on the Mac) to write text. Its whole philosophy is about focus on the task of writing text and no other distractions. What I did is port that feeling to my blog, let me know what you think.
