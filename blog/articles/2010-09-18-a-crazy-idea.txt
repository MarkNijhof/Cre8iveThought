title: A Crazy Idea

Some time ago after the NNUG yearly meeting I was talking to [Sondre Bjell√•s](http://twitter.com/SondreB) and [Lisbeth Skogland](http://twitter.com/LizSkogland) and one thing led to another and suddenly we were talking about arranging a conference. But not any conference may I add:

##Air Conf##

The name may have given you a clue, but this is a conference held in the air. Think for example about getting on a big 747 in London Heathrow destination New York, together with 300 other highly motivated craftsman? We would take-off late in the morning, flight time would be around 8 hours. Now instead of the boring old stuff that you normally have on a flight, we have speakers presenting their ideas and experiences to us. Now **that** is inflight entertainment if you ask me.

###On a plane, really?###

So a 747 holds about 425 passengers which means that there is plenty of room to get some quiet time if you need it. There will be food of-course, I am sure we will be able to get something better then that awful airplane food :)

So looking at the seating layout of a 747 I can clearly see that we will be able to have three simultaneous tracks and have one common area. And of-course the speakers area is taken care of on the upper deck. We will have to make sure that once people pick a track that they would be happy most of the time there, as I am sure that the airline pilots don't want massive groups of people moving in the plane. Also a clear maximum number of people per track would be something that is enforced, we can't all sit in the back.

Making the speaker visible for all attendees in the track will be a bit more of a challenge, but it is a big plane so I am sure that is doable. 

###Really, I mean on a plane?###

Well think of it, what is a conference to employers? Probably most of them see it as something they can do for their employees. A nice treat as it where, but not something useless, something with lots of knowledge sharing. 

So what **Air Conf** offers it exactly that, one 8 hour flight with the best inflight entertainment solution ever. Then one full day in a great place, like New York. And then finally an other 8 hour fully information packed flight back home. How amazingly cool would that be?

Also this is sort of done before, but then it was on a train. This was the [Agile Train from Oslo to Trondheim going to XP 2010](http://xp2010.org/content.ap?thisId=68) and I believe it was a great success. But a train is very limited with respect to what location it is going, and a plane is just so much cooler!

##The Speakers##

There are many speakers who travel between Europe and the US for work; so I figured is that some speakers perhaps only want to be on **Air Conf** one way. For example someone from Europe would be at **Air Conf** on the first leg, but will stay in the US to do some consulting. In the US we would pick-up another speaker for the second leg back home.
