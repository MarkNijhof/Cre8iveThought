> One of my kids: "Why are you going outside?"

> Me: "Because I am going to the store"

> One of my kids: "Oh ok" "Why are you going to the store?"

> Me: "Because I have to buy some food"

> One of my kids: "Are you going to buy Pancakes?"

> Me: "No, we are ..."

> One of my kids: "Why not, I want pancakes!"

> Me: "... going to eat lasagna"

> One of my kids: "Pancakes!"

> Me: "We ate pancakes yesterday, we can't eat pancakes everyday"

> One of my kids: "Why not? They taste so good"

> Me: "Because they are not healthy"

> One of my kids: "Oh ok"

> Me: "Bye bye"

> One of my kids: "Bye dad!"

... the door closes and I go the the store. After I bought all the things I needed I come home, I open the door ...

> One of my kids: "Hi daddy" "Have you been to the store?"

> Me: "Yes I have :)"

> One of my kids: "Did you buy pancakes?"

> Me: "No I did not :) I bought lasagna"

> One of my kids: "Why didn't you buy pancakes, I wanted pancakes"

> Me: "Well because I didn't want pancakes since we ate pancakes yesterday"

> One of my kids: "But I want Pancakes"

> Me: "What did I just say?"

> One of my kids: "Ooohhh OK! :("

How great is this? I mean yes it can get a bit annoying at times, but overall it is just great. Kids are so curious about everything that they keep on asking Why questions the whole time. And they do not yet have the notion of sounding stupid, so when they don't understand something they will just ask you again, and again, and again. 

The question I would like to ask is: 

>"Why have we stopped asking the question why over and over again?"

It is a good question, don't stop asking it!
