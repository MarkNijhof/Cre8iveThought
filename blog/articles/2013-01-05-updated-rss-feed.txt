Just a very short note: I updated the URL for my RSS feed, please subscribe to the following URL to keep getting my updates: [http://feeds.feedburner.com/Cre8iveThought](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Cre8iveThought)

The reason for this is that there is no way anymore that I can login to my previous dashboard :( Google seems to have forgotten about me.

Thanks and a Happy New Year!
