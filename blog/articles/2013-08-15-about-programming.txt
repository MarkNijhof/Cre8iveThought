A few weeks ago I started an other Twitter account [About Programming](https://twitter.com/abt_programming) and the accompanying [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/abt.programming) with the main purpose to bring you programmer insights from influencial people (mostly programmers themselves). 

Short 140 character sound bites, a source of inspiration and joy.

> "If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in" 
> - *Edsger Dijkstra*

<br/>

> "The best way to get a project done faster is to start sooner" 
> - *Jim Highsmith*

# The goal
I want to inspire you to be better! After reading these types of sound bites I have often found myself thinking about how they apply to my current situation, often I think they are funny. 

> It is funny because it is true

I am Dutch so I like sarcasm a lot, this account will also have its share of sarcasm.

> "Real programmers don't document. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand"

# Continuous Learning
What I really hope to achieve is a way that we as a group can benefit and I'll try to get special offers from other programmers who are writing books or doing screencasts. I know that sometimes I only need a small nudge into the right direction to start learning something new. I hope that this can be that nudge for you.

# The About Programming mailing list
This is where the nicest nuggests will be shared with you, the posts that where most popular. But also any special offers that I can tear out of the hands of those famous programmers.
