A few weeks ago I started an other Twitter account [About Programming](https://twitter.com/abt_programming) and the accompanying [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/abt.programming) to bring you programmer insights from influential people (mostly programmers themselves). 

Short 140 character sound bites, a source of inspiration and joy.

# The goal
I want to inspire you to be better! After reading these types of sound bites I have often found myself thinking about how they apply to my current situation, often I think they are funny. 

> It is funny because it is true!

I am Dutch, so this account will have its share of sarcasm.

> "Real programmers don't document. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand"

# The About Programming mailing list
This is where the nicest nuggets will be shared with you, the most popular posts. But also any special offers that I can tear from the hands of programmers that have writen books, created screen casts or have anything else of value for you.

I believe that sometimes all you need is a small push into the right direction, a special deal to pickup that special book that teaches you something completely new. An amazing screen cast that shows you you should change the (way|place) you work!

These special offers will only be given in the mailing list as I will need to provide some predictability around the numbers. A tweet can suddenly be seen by millions, with a personal e-mail this is much less likely.
