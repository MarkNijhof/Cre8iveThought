title: About Programming

A few weeks ago I started an other Twitter account [About Programming](https://twitter.com/abt_programming) and the accompanying [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/abt.programming) with the main purpose to bring short programmer insights from influencial people (mostly programmers themselves). I hope that the short 140 charecter sound bites form a source of inspiration and joy.

But this is only the start, I also want to promote continious learning and therefore I will try to talk to people writing books, doing screencasts and other sources of learning materials and I'll try to get you special deals. Because I know from my own experiences that sometimes it only takes a little nudge to get you going and start learning something new.

If you want to be kept up to date regarding these efforts then please signup for the About Programming mailing list right now!
