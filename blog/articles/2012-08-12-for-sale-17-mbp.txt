I have for sale: a very nice 17" (1920x1200 resolution) MacBook Pro bought early 2009. The processor is a 2.93GHz Duo 2 Core and it has 8GB of memory. I replaced the original HHD with a 160GB SSD which has made it a lot faster. Furher it basically has all options available at that time.

It is a great machine but for how I work lately it is just too big. Currently it is just gathering dust and that is a shame for such a nice machine, so I am selling it. I can provide more details and pictures for those who are interested. And if you are just send me an e-mail to Mark.Nijhof@Cre8iveThought.com 

The price is negotionable
