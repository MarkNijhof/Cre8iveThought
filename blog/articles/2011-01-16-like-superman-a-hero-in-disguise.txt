When you run into him on the street you wouldn't know it; he looks be like any other person, perhaps a bit geeky tho. Craftsman is just like Superman, he is a hero in disguise. 

It is amazing how many people claim to have seen him and other who are set out to dis-prove his existence. So lets look a bit closer into this weird phenomena called Craftsman.

This is my hypothesis so most likely it won't exactly fit your theory, but that's fine.

First lets look at this super hero's name "Craftsman" I believe that this is a degeneration of the German word "kraft" which means power, so Craftsman is really Powerman in German. This makes me conclude that the origin of the Craftsman lies in Germany.

I guess you didn't see that one coming?

Ok let the saga continue; Craftsman is an avid crusher of bugs and other unwanted creatures, something eye-witnesses say he may actually enjoy just a little bit too much. But it has been said that he actually believes that prevention is better then providing a cure. 

So the story is that he created a small army of digital creatures which he calls "Features" and "Specs". These creatures have been specifically trained to catch bugs when they are still very small, easy to kill and cannot do to much harm yet.

I believe that these creatures enable Craftsman to catch about 80% of the nasty bugs before they reach adulthood and become very hard to handle. The remaining 20% is caught by continuously keeping a watchful eye on the city.

Craftsman is also big into increasing his knowledge and practicing his skills as he knows that the minute he stops improving himself he is loosing the battle. The bugs he is fighting are getting more and more sophisticated. Rumors are that he has even build his own Dojo especially for the purpose of training himself to get better at crushing them.

Besides constantly improving him self it is also said that he spends a lot of time educating the public mostly in the form of blog posts and other written material under different pseudo names. He may even have a side-kick call it an apprentice helping him out while learning the trade. But for this there is even less supporting evidence then the actual existence of Craftsman himself. All tho I myself strongly believe in both of them.

His hide-out is believed to be some sort of modern cave, he has been heard calling it the "Man Cave". As far as my studies tell me nobody has ever been inside it and thus we know nothing about what happens there. I can only imagine that he has some special research equipment there to completely understand new species of bugs which helps him finding better ways of beating them.

Personally I think it is extremely ironic that Craftsman's alter ego is believed to be that of a Software Developer, and that his Twitter description says:
>"I am a person working in the software industry and my main responsibility is to put all my power into deliver the highest possible value to my stakeholders"

The sound effect have been recorded by [Brian Romeo](http://blog.brianromero.com/?p=148) during one of the bug squashing exercises of Craftsman. Unfortunately it was to dark to get him on screen, so his real identity is as of yet still a complete mystery.

I believe in Craftsman and I think he will be doing great things, I also believe this is still a very incomplete picture of him and that in due time we will learn more about the mysterious forces which drives this great individual to be who he is.
