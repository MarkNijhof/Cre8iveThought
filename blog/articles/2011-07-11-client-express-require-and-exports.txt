I recently [introduced](http://cre8ivethought.com/blog/2011/06/25/client-express) you to [Client Express](http://clientexpressjs.com/) where I explained that the goal is to copy the API of [Express](http://expressjs.com/) ([Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)) but for use on the client. This will enable you to share code between the server and the client, specifically the routing.

And I got a pretty decent part done when I blogged about it, but that was one major difference and that was that on the server you use **require** to include different JavaScript libraries and within these libraries you would use **exports** to export your functionality to the application.

##require('...')##

Below here you see two common uses of **require**, the first one **require('express')** is to add the Express module and the second one **require(__dirname + '/examples/server_routing' ).example_routing()** is to load a local JavaScript file and execute the function **example_routing()** which is defined inside this JavaScript file.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1074797.js?file=server.js"></script>

##exports....##

Here we see the local JavaScript file that was loaded using **require** in the above example. Important to note here is that we see how **exports** is used to expose the function **example_routing()** to the user of the library.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1074797.js?file=server_routing.js"></script>

##And now in the browser##

Well both **require** and **exports** do not exist in the browser, so we need to add them. There are already different approaches that enable you to use **require** I believe all of them are an implementation of [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/) so I added my own implementation for that to Client Express and after some tuning and a pull request I got that to work nicely. 

The thing I didn't see was how people solved the **exports** problem. And because I didn't want to stop halfway I started thinking and came up with the following solution. My **require** will try to download the requested JavaScript file if it cannot find the module in the registered modules. When it is downloaded it will then do something **EVIL** it will do the following:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1074797.js?file=eval.js"></script>

That's right I am using **eval** to evaluate the JavaScript text found in the downloaded JavaScript file and attach the exported functions to my exports object. After the **eval** my exports object is then placed in the registered modules so this process only happens once. After that the **exports** object is returned from the **require** function exposing the functions defined in the just downloaded JavaScript file.

This enables me to use the exact same syntax on the server as on the client for both **require** and **exports**. See below here the full implementation:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1074797.js?file=client.express.require.js"></script>

Now as you can see I am always defining these functions even if an other library has defined them already, but I do copy the registered modules from those other libraries. 

One problem is when my CommonJS implementation is overwritten by some library loaded after my Client Express because then I would loose the download and eval capabilities. So for the time being my library needs to either be loaded last, or the other libraries should check for existence of the **require** functionality and if it exists don't overwrite it.

I am however thinking about a way that overwrites it again after the Client Express server has started ensuring it will work when during runtime the code requires additional libraries. 

Please let me know what you think.
