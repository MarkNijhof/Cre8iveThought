Why do so many people and even actual developers think Software Development is easy, something that everybody can do? Do we really have to look back and see how many projects have failed? Or how many are a maintenance nightmare? Let me tell you by approximation:”Way too many”.

So can we maybe conclude that Software Development is not that easy, in fact let’s conclude that it is hard, very hard actually! Sure everybody can write some code that does something, even businessman can do this, be it in excel but still. Proper Software Development, software that will stand the test of time, or in other words software that is easy to change and extend, that is not so easy. That requires the developers to actually think about their design, anticipate change.

Anticipating change is hard; change is something humans by nature don’t handle very well. So anticipating to something like that is even harder, perhaps we don’t even want to think about it. Now let’s at least try to make this anticipation a little bit easier shall we?

That’s where principles like the SOLID principles come into play. These help us to anticipate change, enable us to deal with change much easier. They help the developer to properly design the software for the future. [Uncle Bob](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/category/uncle-bobs-blatherings) has just written a nice blog post “[Get a SOLID start](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/02/12/getting-a-solid-start)” I recommend everybody to read this and follow his advice.

As a conclusion I would like to go back to the title, and I want to state that Software Development is _not_ for Dummies, it is for developers that consider themselves craftsman’s, developers that take pride in their code.

Keep learning, always!
