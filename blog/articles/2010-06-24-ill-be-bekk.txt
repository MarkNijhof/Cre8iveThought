Just a little note; I am very happy to announce that I’ll be joining [BEKK](http://www.bekk.no/) from August on, I’ll be working mostly on .Net projects I am sure, but I have the intention to squeeze some Ruby projects in there as well. And perhaps this can become the majority soon as well?

Anyway it will be great fun and many cool college’s, so looking very much forward to it.
