title: CQRS the book
author: Mark Nijhof
published: true

In 2009 I have had the pleasure of spending a 2 day course and many geek beers with Greg Young talking about Domain-Driven Design specifically focussed on Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).

The example project I created based on these discussions was very well received by the community and regarded a good reference project to explain and learn the patterns that make up CQRS. I decided to add the different blog posts I wrote about the example into a single book so it is easy to find and read.
