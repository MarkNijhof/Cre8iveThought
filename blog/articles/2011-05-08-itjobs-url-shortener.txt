title: ITJo.bs Url Shortener

Every time that I want to learn something new I like to do this through an actual project. I have noticed by myself that the good old "CD Catalog" or "Book Index" type of projects never work for me, they are not real. 

No real problems, no real learning. 

Now this does not mean I don't like to do Code Kata's or Koans to practice my coding and problem solving skills, but these are all very small and very dedicated towards a single goal. The things that I like to use real projects for are usually bigger, f.ex. learn a new language or understand a type of architecture.

So I wanted to learn Ruby and the ecosystem that it is surrounded by. This required a real project because history tells me I would fail otherwise, mind you I might still fail but that is a whole different story.

I have always been annoyed by the job sites as it is very hard to get a good impression of a company and the actual job being posted. It takes a lot of research and talking to people to even get an idea whether you will fit in or not. 

I now know that going the social way to find work will be a more accurate way to find something that would fit for me. Asking people you know and or people that know you asking you gives in my experience much better results. Hence the practice of certain/many companies to give bonuses for new hires. They know that if an employee is recommending someone that the chances of success is higher then when a random guy is responding to the job ad.

But this is not known or practiced by everyone, and that's where I hope to make life just a little bit easier for both people looking for work as companies looking to hire.

##ITJo.bs##

So I found my project, but to make it real it had to have a real home, which in my little world means a place on the internet, a domain name. I have gone over many domain names, and as always all the good ones are taken ... until I ran into the .BS (Bahamas) domain extension. 

Please welcome [http://itjo.bs/](http://itjo.bs/) to the internet!

Now I found a home for my project and in the mean-time via [99 Designs](http://99designs.com/) I also found a design for it. So I could start coding. And that is what I did, I started out using Sinatra, then went to Padrino and finally I am using Rails 3 (all tho I am not sure this is actually final). With each framework I ran into different problems/issues and I now have a much better feel for what would fit where. 

But the project didn't move forward very much, this has many reasons and all of them lie outside of the project itself (i.e. moving and stuff like that). But I felt that I wanted to deliver something related to it. 

So I started thinking what would be the easiest and quickest thing I could release as a stand-alone service (i.e. valuable thing on its own). 

##ITJo.bs Url Shortener##

I figured an Url Shortener service would fit that description. It was something that was in the pipe-line anyway, I mean the domain itself is ideal for it. 

Think about it; if you have an IT position on your website or somewhere else and you want to link to it on Twitter or in your e-mail (why do longer urls break so often in e-mails anyway?). So you need to shorten it, then why not use an url shortener that clearly shows to the receiver of the link that it is about an IT Job. Much better then using any of the other good url shorteners. 

> What's this link that Joe send me now? http://itjo.bs/123 Hmmm maybe I shouldn't open this at work ...

###The works###

Now considering that I had the design and the domain ready it only took approximately 1 day of figuring things out and building it. 

And this is what making it real means to me, now people can actually be using the product, no matter how small it is. Now I can build upon this small service and start adding more functionality/value. 

And in the mean-time I hope this service is catching on a little bit so that when I release more functionality I also have an audience that is potentially going to use that new functionality.

###The technique###

So the longer story is that you can find the code on GitHub: [https://github.com/MarkNijhof/itjobs-urlshortener](https://github.com/MarkNijhof/itjobs-urlshortener) 

The short answer is that I am using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) and using [Redis](http://www.redis.io/) for data storage. 

##Finally##

ATM running the site is not costing me anything, but I sincerely hope that that will be changing soon. So please use [the service](http://itjo.bs/) and tell me what you think. Also if you have things that you have always wanted on a job board (be it as an employee or employer) then let me know.

So just go to: [http://itjo.bs/](http://itjo.bs/)
