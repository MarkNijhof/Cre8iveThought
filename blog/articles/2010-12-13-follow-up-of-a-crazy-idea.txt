After the many responses I got about [a crazy idea](http://cre8ivethought.com/blog/2010/09/22/a-crazy-idea/) I had a little while ago with some friends I felt I had to give you a small follow-up on that. Unfortunately this crazy idea won't fly (phun intended of-course). 

There are a bit too many problems to solve, the main one being the noise levels inside the plane which sort of defeats the whole purpose of listening to speakers during the flight.

I did learn a lot from this little exercise; f.ex. I now know that I can charter an A330 (360 seats) for GBP 240.000 and a 474B (581 seats) for GBP 430.000 which if we calculate with a 66% capacity would make the A330 cost GBP 1.000 per person and the 747B would be GBP 1.110 per person. This is including taxes and catering for a round trip from the London to New York. Now to be honest these prices don't sound too bad too me. Add an other USD 1.000 for two nights at the hotel in New York and we get a total price of USD 2.750 / GBP 1.740 for "accommodation" which is not cheap, but remember this is something really special.

Well maybe we'll fly together one day in the future, but a.t.m. it is not going to happen, not by me anyway.

Sorry
