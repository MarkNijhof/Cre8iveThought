title: Just explain it to me

Today I was sitting in the office enjoying the view from the window; there were some ducks playing in the pond outside when suddenly the door opened and a guy came walking in. 

He started talking -his voice sounded slightly annoyed- about some problem he had. So he started explaining it to me. Honestly at that time I had no clue what he was talking about, buti I just let him continue as it seemed to matter very much to him. Perhaps after hearing more about it the problem will get clearer to me. So the guy continues to talk to me for another 5 minutes. 

I got distracted as there was some sort of comotion at the pond, I think it was a cat or something, it went too fast for me to clearly see it. 

Then suddenly I was brought back to the here and now, the guy had abruptly rissen from his chair. I thought he was upset about the lack of response I had given him to his problem. But when I looked him in the eyes I saw he was happy, actually he was thanking me for helping him. Then he just walked out of the room and left me wondering what this was all about. Strangly this sort of thing happens to me all the time. 

I looked out the window again, the comotion at the pond had settled down, I wish I could be there as well.

Sometimes all what is needed to solve a problem is to explain it to someone else
