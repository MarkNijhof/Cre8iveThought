##Personal projects##

**Link:** [https://inqob.com](https://inqob.com)<br />
**Description:**<br />
Mark is creating a service that enables anybody to include the ability to accept and display job advertisements on their blog or other kind of websites by just including a few lines of JavaScript code. He is writing this service in Node.js and uses cloud services like; GitHub, Heroku, MongoHQ, RedisToGo, Mandrill, TravisCI and HireFire. Which basically means that the only thing still on his local machine is his text editor.

###OSS CQRS project###
**Link:** [http://github.com/MarkNijhof/Fohjin](http://github.com/MarkNijhof/Fohjin)<br />
**Description:**<br />
Mark has created a complete working example in C# accordingly to a new architecture patterns thought of by Greg Young. He is now also working on making this into a sort of framework so that reuse of this pattern will be simplified. And even though this example is several years old he still get e-mails and tweets from people saying it has helped them understand the different principles and patterns being used.

###Create trading strategies using C# and Quant Developer###
**Link:** [http://www.smartquant.com/](http://www.smartquant.com/)<br />
**Description:**<br />
Mark is very interested in the stock market and has full intention to start trading himself, after reading many books and articles he realized that most mistakes are made because of human emotions. So he wanted to take out the human. After searching the internet he found a product called QuantDeveloper, this framework is completely written in C# and allows for the creation of fully automated trading strategies. This product really combines the two passions Mark has; C# and trading.

###Web based Content Management System###
**Description:**<br />
This Content Management System (CMS) is completely written in C# 2.0 (this is also dating it back to around 2000 - 2002) and has SQL Server 2000 as its back end. The CMS is completely web based, meaning that all of its futures are accessible via a web browser. The system had the ability to manage multiple sites, using role management for security and has versioning functionality for both web pages and documents. By separating the content from the design it is easy to create or alter the design for the entire website. Mark started this project because he wanted a way to manage his own websites and wanted to start using C#. Unfortunately nothing of that exists nowadays.
