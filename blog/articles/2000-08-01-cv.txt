He is always learning new technologies en theories to improve his programming and design skills. While learning he also loves teaching.  In his free time he has contributed to some OSS projects and he created a complete [CQRS example](https://github.com/MarkNijhof/Fohjin/tree/master/Fohjin.DDD.Example) in C# which is now a reference project for this type of architecture. 

Mark is also very active in the developer community, having been a board member of [Oslo XP](http://www.meetup.com/oslo-xp/), [Node.js Oslo](http://www.meetup.com/NodeJSOslo/) and [NNUG Bergen & Oslo](http://www.nnug.no/).

##Personal projects##
<hr />

###Inqob.com###
**Link:** [https://inqob.com](https://inqob.com)<br />
**Description:**<br />
Mark is creating a service that enables anybody to include the ability to accept and display job advertisements on their blog or other kind of websites by just including a few lines of JavaScript code. He is writing this service in Node.js and uses cloud services like; GitHub, Heroku, MongoHQ, RedisToGo, Mandrill, TravisCI and HireFire. Which basically means that the only thing still on his local machine is his text editor. 

###OSS Client Express JS###
**Link:** [http://clientexpressjs.com/](http://clientexpressjs.com/)<br />
**Description:**<br />
Mark is duplicating the API that Node.js Express.js offers but for use on the client (read browser) this library will be using PushState and PopState to enhance the browsing experience by handling certain requests on the client instead of placing these on the server. And because the API is the same as that of Express.js you will be able to copy/re-use most of the functionality from the server to the client. This is inspired by Davis.js and Express.js.

###OSS blog (all code and content of my blog)###
**Link:** [http://github.com/MarkNijhof/Cre8iveThought](http://github.com/MarkNijhof/Cre8iveThought)<br />
**Description:**<br />
Mark has created his own blog engine in Ruby after facing some limits with Toto (a Ruby based blog engine) where I basically used the same principles but made it independent of a web framework. Read more about it here: [http://cre8ivethought.com/blog/2010/12/06/good-bye-toto-hello-dorsey/](http://cre8ivethought.com/blog/2010/12/06/good-bye-toto-hello-dorsey/)

###OSS CQRS project###
**Link:** [http://github.com/MarkNijhof/Fohjin](http://github.com/MarkNijhof/Fohjin)<br />
**Description:**<br />
Mark has created a complete working example in C# accordingly to a new architecture patterns thought of by Greg Young. He is now also working on making this into a sort of framework so that reuse of this pattern will be simplified. And even though this example is several years old he still get e-mails and tweets from people saying it has helped them understand the different principles and patterns being used.

###Contributing to OSS FubuMVC project###
**Link:** [http://www.fubumvc.com/](http://www.fubumvc.com/)<br />
**Description:**<br />
Mark was actively contributing to the Open Source project FubuMVC, which is an alternative to ASP.Net MVC. This is a project written in C# using all the possible features of the .Net 3.5 SP1 framework.

###Create trading strategies using C# and Quant Developer###
**Link:** [http://www.smartquant.com/](http://www.smartquant.com/)<br />
**Description:**<br />
Mark is very interested in the stock market and has full intention to start trading himself, after reading many books and articles he realized that most mistakes are made because of human emotions. So he wanted to take out the human. After searching the internet he found a product called QuantDeveloper, this framework is completely written in C# and allows for the creation of fully automated trading strategies. This product really combines the two passions Mark has; C# and trading.

###Web based Content Management System###
**Description:**<br />
This Content Management System (CMS) is completely written in C# 2.0 (this is also dating it back to around 2000 - 2002) and has SQL Server 2000 as its back end. The CMS is completely web based, meaning that all of its futures are accessible via a web browser. The system had the ability to manage multiple sites, using role management for security and has versioning functionality for both web pages and documents. By separating the content from the design it is easy to create or alter the design for the entire website. Mark started this project because he wanted a way to manage his own websites and wanted to start using C#. Unfortunately nothing of that exists nowadays.
