Mark has been delivering software based solutions since 2000. Throughout this time there is a constant trend of learning new things, be it technical things, like a different programming language or more things like different software development methodologies. Mark is always eager to learn something new. Mark is also a great fan of sharing knowledge; for example his CQRS OSS example framework, or his latest project, the book "Getting functional with Erlang". But overall, Mark likes to code!
