I would love to work at 37signals and be part of the team, I believe that I would be a good fit. I am very passionate and good at what I do. I believe in continuous improvement and in delivering value. And I get the job done. Working for 37signals would be a great opportunity which I'll grab with both hands.

##I create stuff##

My name is Mark Nijhof and I grew up on the country side in Holland and have always been solving problems; thinking about how to make things easier. Silly things like a special three part shovel to clean the outside drains or figuring out how to divide the stables so we could fit more horses in there. 

But because of the great outdoors where I grew up I got introduced to computers fairly late. So I am not your geek that started hacking at a very young age, no instead I learned the basics of programming at school. But the real art of programming I learned later; sometime between my second job and where I am now. In fact I am still learning each and every day. And that is one part that attracts me so much to programming, the continues challenges and new things I can learn.

The other part that makes programming so much fun is that I can put so much creativity into the process. Making things is just cool, but when people are happy with them it gives an absolute amazing feeling.

I love programming, not quite in the same way as I love my family, but it is getting close. I am currently working for BEKK Consulting in Oslo Norway and it is great. I have only been working there for four months, but already it is the best place I have ever worked for. The many smart people and the real focus on delivering what the client wants while maintaining quality is a nice change. 

When I saw the tweet from @37signals announcing that you are looking for 2 more programmers to join the team I thought this is great! I am following your blog and have listed to your last book. I love the ideas behind 37signals as well as the openness. Your focus on what the customer need and the constant thrive to keep things simple are like a small shower in Spring; very refreshing!

##But,##

Maybe you want to sit down first?

I have been working with C# since the first beta’s came out in 2000, I had a few years of Delphi in between as well as some PHP and Perl. Well by now I hope you haven’t put my letter on the “No way in hell” stack yet because I like to make it a little bit more interesting for you. 

During my years as a programmer I always have had very a strong focus on web based applications and plain websites. I really like JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Lately I have been TDD-ing my JavaScript code as well using JSpec. I have also switched my Windows machines to Macs. And I am happy to say that the last 7 months I have not seen Visual Studio, but instead I have been working with VIM programming in Ruby. 

**And I love it!**

And that is why I want to work at 37signals, I want to work with Ruby and Rails. I want to create great programs that change how people work, I want to work with great people and learn each day. I want to create things that come as natural to people as the iPad does for my four year old.

##Some history##

In the early days of my career I created a content management system that would allow users to manage their website from a web browser. It was reasonably complete with multi language support and the versioning of content. It was also meant to be used by the smaller companies, those who didn’t have IT staff and didn’t know anything about templates and CSS. I made the admin side look like Windows as this would be most recognizable for the users. Unfortunately nothing really exists of this anymore except an PDF with screenshots and a Dutch explanation. 

Lately I have been using GitHub to store my code on and one of the things that have gotten some publicity is my CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) example that I created to understand the architecture better. The readme contains several links to blog posts I wrote explaining the architecture. The example is written in C#.

I have also presented at [NDC (Norwegian Developer Conference)](http://www.ndc2010.no) on Test-Driving your JavaScript code. I did some live coding using TDD to add some functionality to existing JavaScript code. This was a very exciting experience one that I like to repeat.

The way I learn the best is by doing, and I don’t mean silly CD application projects because that never works. So when I started learning Ruby I wanted something that was serious, and one thing lacking in Norway is a really good job site specifically for IT people. So I decided to create that when I started learning Ruby. I have many ideas for this; something that enables more meta information about the companies and the people so that better choices can be made. I have only just started with this so there is not much to show yet. Technically I am using Padrino, Haml, SASS and MongoDB, but I am looking into moving to Rails actually. I started with Sinatra because I wanted less magic and more Ruby. Anyway if it works I make some money, and if it doesn’t I have learned Ruby.

I also presented at [Smidig 2010](http://www.smidig2010.no/) (Smidig is Norwegian for Agile) about why people should test their freaking JavaScript code. This was just a lightning talk.

And finally I just re-wrote my blog engine, I was using Toto but that became a bit too limited for what I wanted to do so I decided to rewrite the same functionality but now on top of Sinatra. I blogged about it as well.

##Location##

Currently we live in Oslo, and I hope to stay here for a little while longer, but in the future I see myself moving to Chicago and work at the beautiful new offices you have created.

##Finally##

I have been in different places in the world because I initiate things myself and don't wait for others to hand it to me. So I know that my profile is not your typical 37signal profile technically speaking, but technical stuff is not hard to learn. Being a certain person you either are or are not. So with that in mind I hope to hear from you soon to continue talking about a new position at 37signals.
