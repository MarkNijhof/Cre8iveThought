I have had the pleasure of spending a 2 day course and many geek beers with Greg Young talking about Domain-Driven Design specifically focussed on Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).

And because this interests me very much I thought about writing an example, now this example is already well on its way. I am also preparing an actual blog post describing the example in great detail, but I am running a bit out of time so I decided to publish the code even without the supporting blog post. So the DDD Yahoo list has already seen the URL which is: <http://github.com/MarkNijhof/Fohjin>

Also Jan van Ryswyck has asked me to do a talk about this example on the next E-VAN (18 November 2009), more details can be found here: [Europe Virtual ALT.NET](http://europevan.blogspot.com/2009/10/next-european-van-on-18-november-2009.html) So if you have any questions then just submit them to the [E-VAN Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/europevan/browse_thread/thread/a8b076a86510a4fd) as the blog mentions.
