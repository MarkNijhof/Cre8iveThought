title: CQRS à la Greg Young example code
author: Mark Nijhof
date: 03/11/2009

I have had the pleasure of spending a 2 day course and many geek beers with Greg Young talking about Domain-Driven Design specifically focussed on Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).

And because this interests me very much I thought about writing an example, now this example is already well on its way. I am also preparing an actual blog post describing the example in great detail, but I am running a bit out of time so I decided to publish the code even without the supporting blog post. So the DDD Yahoo list has already seen the URL which is: http://github.com/MarkNijhof/Fohjin

Also Jan van Ryswyck has asked me to do a talk about this example on the next E-VAN (18 November 2009), more details can be found here: Europe Virtual ALT.NET So if you have any questions then just submit them to the E-VAN Google group as the blog mentions.
